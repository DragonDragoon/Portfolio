Help

To run this easily on Windows

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/DragonDragoon/Portfolio/raw/master/Lua/ITCS-4102_Programming_Languages/Advanced%20Lua%20Calculator/LuaConsole.zip">LuaConsole.zip</a>, extract somewhere, and run `iuplua51.exe` from the archive. 
2. Click `Load...` and select the `Three_of_a_crime.lua` file; it should load into the multiline textbox.
3. Then, simply click `Execute` and the program will run with GUI and all.

Instead of doing the above, you can also install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.16/Windows%20Libraries/Static/Lua51/iup-3.16-Lua51_Win32_vc11_lib.zip/download">this</a> library into your Lua5.1 lib folder (For example mine was `C:\Programs\Lua\5.1\lib`), which would let IUPLua bind with Lua.

Macintosh and Linux will need to visit <a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/en/executables.html">http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/en/executables.html</a> and note the IupLua Console instructions.
